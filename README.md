# Ratify

The project provides a framework to integrate scenarios that require
verification of reference artifacts and provides a set of interfaces
that can be consumed by various systems that can participate in
artifact ratification.

**WARNING:** This is experimental code. It is not considered production-grade
by its developers, nor is it "supported" software.

- We meet regularly to discuss and prioritize issues. The meeting may get cancelled due to holidays, all cancellation will be posted to meeting notes prior to the meeting.

## Quick Start

Try out ratify in Kuberenetes through Gatekeeper as the admission controller.

Prerequisite: Kubernetes v1.20 or higher

- Setup Gatekeeper with [external data](https://open-policy-agent.github.io/gatekeeper/website/docs/externaldata)

```bash
helm repo add gatekeeper https://open-policy-agent.github.io/gatekeeper/charts

helm install gatekeeper/gatekeeper  \
    --name-template=gatekeeper \
    --namespace gatekeeper-system --create-namespace \
    --set enableExternalData=true \
    --set validatingWebhookTimeoutSeconds=7
```

NOTE: `validatingWebhookTimeoutSeconds` increased from 3 to 7 so all Ratify operations complete in complex scenarios. Kubernetes v1.20 or higher is REQUIRED to increase timeout.  

- Deploy ratify and a `demo` constraint on gatekeeper

```bash
helm repo add ratify https://deislabs.github.io/ratify
helm install ratify \
    ratify/ratify --atomic

kubectl apply -f https://deislabs.github.io/ratify/charts/ratify-gatekeeper/templates/constraint.yaml
```

Once the installation is completed, you can test the deployment of an image that is signed using Notary V2 solution.

- Create the namespace `demo`

```bash=
kubectl create ns demo
```

- This will successfully create the pod `demo` in the namespace `demo`

```bash=
kubectl run demo --image=ratify.azurecr.io/testimage:signed -n demo
```

- Now deploy an unsigned image

```bash=
kubectl run demo1 --image=ratify.azurecr.io/testimage:unsigned -n demo
```

You will see a deny message from Gatekeeper as the image doesn't have any signatures.

You just validated the container images in your k8s cluster!

- Uninstall Ratify

```bash=
kubectl delete -f https://deislabs.github.io/ratify/charts/ratify-gatekeeper/templates/constraint.yaml
helm delete ratify
kubectl delete namespace demo
```

## Documents

The [docs](docs/README.md) folder contains the beginnings of a formal
specification for the Reference Artifact Verification framework and its plugin model.
